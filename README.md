Healthcare Analytics – Executive Report
Executive Summary

This report translates the Healthcare Analysis Dashboard into executive-level insights with a focus on heart-disease risk identification, operational burden, and financial exposure. Using Power BI, large-scale healthcare data has been transformed into actionable intelligence to support clinical and administrative decision-making.

Core Insight:
Patients aged above 50 with high cholesterol are 3.2× more likely to fall into the high heart-disease risk category, making age and cholesterol the most critical combined risk indicators.

1. Introduction

The Healthcare Analysis Dashboard project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to derive meaningful insights related to patient health risks, hospital efficiency, and billing trends. The project utilizes Power BI to visualize complex healthcare datasets through interactive dashboards, enabling faster interpretation and data-driven decision-making for healthcare stakeholders.

2. Objectives

To analyze patient health data effectively

To identify high-risk patients using data-driven insights

To monitor hospital performance and billing exposure

To support executive and clinical decision-making

To visually present healthcare trends using Power BI

3. Dataset Description

The dataset consists of healthcare records containing:

Patient demographics (age, gender)

Medical indicators (cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure)

Heart-disease risk levels

Hospital admissions and test results

Lifestyle factors (smoking, physical activity)

Billing and insurance information

This data is used to calculate KPIs, trends, and risk distributions across multiple healthcare dimensions.

4. Team Members & Responsibilities

Abhinav Mishra – Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Predictive Modeling

Ankush Ramola – Health Segment Querying and Data Filtering

Avi Gupta – Final Report Preparation and Insight Interpretation

Sachin Ade – Power BI Dashboard Design, DAX Measures, Visualization

5. Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop – Data modeling and visualization

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – KPI and metric calculations

Microsoft Excel / CSV – Data source and preprocessing

Windows Operating System

6. System Architecture

The system follows a data visualization architecture:

Raw healthcare data imported into Power BI

Data cleaning and transformation using Power Query

Data modeling and relationships

KPI creation using DAX measures

Interactive dashboards for real-time analysis

7. Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes:

KPI cards for key metrics

Bar, line, and pie charts

Risk distribution visuals

Filters for hospital, age, test results, and lifestyle indicators

It provides a consolidated view of patient demographics, medical conditions, lifestyle risks, hospital performance, and billing exposure.

8. Key Metrics & Executive Interpretation
Metric	Value	Executive Interpretation
Total Patients	52,244	Large population base for preventive analytics
Average Age	50 years	Critical threshold for chronic disease risk
High-Risk Patients	23,899	Nearly half the population requires monitoring
Avg. Systolic BP	128	Borderline hypertensive trend
Total Billing Amount	₹1.335M	High financial exposure from chronic care
9. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Patients

High-Risk vs Low-Risk Patients

Average Billing Amount

Patient Distribution by Age

Hospital-wise Performance

10. Analysis & Key Insights

Age × Cholesterol Effect: Strongest predictor of heart-disease risk

Lifestyle Impact: Physically inactive patients dominate the high-risk group

Gender Neutrality: Risk distribution is nearly equal across male and female patients

Operational Load: Abnormal and inconclusive test results increase avoidable admissions

Financial Exposure: High-risk patients contribute significantly to billing amounts

11. Advantages of the System

Simplifies complex healthcare data analysis

Enables faster, data-driven decision-making

Reduces manual reporting effort

Interactive and user-friendly dashboards

12. Limitations

Results depend on data accuracy

Limited predictive modeling scope

Requires Power BI access for usage

13. Conclusion

The Healthcare Analysis Dashboard demonstrates how Power BI-driven analytics can enhance healthcare decision-making by identifying high-risk patients, reducing operational inefficiencies, and improving financial visibility. The project is well-suited for academic submission, portfolio presentation, and real-world healthcare analytics applications.
